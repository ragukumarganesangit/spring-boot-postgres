//popular patterns defined by gang of four

    //Richard Helm
    //ralph Johnson
    //John Vlissides

    //pattern needs to be apply to recurring problem not to the

    //SOLID principle :
    //single responsibility   - class shpiuld do only one thins
    //open closed  - allow the change but doesnt require to modify the code. can be achieved thru inheritance
    //liskov substrituion - if you inherite suv from car , then sub class need to be used else dont inherit
    //interface segregation - better to have small and many interfaces than bigger one
    //dependecy injection  - depency can be injected from outside

    //PATERN CLASSIFICATION
    //1.CREATIONAL PATTERN  -> Builder-separates construction of objects from its representation , SingleTon , Prototype, Factory(some type passed and based on that we create object)
    //2.BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN ->Observer - notifies when state of object changes
    //3.STRUCTURAL PATTERN  -> Proxy , Adapter - Provides a surrogate for another object to control access to it , Composite Design pattern
